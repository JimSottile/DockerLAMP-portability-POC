# DockerLAMP-portability-POC
Testing a demonstration of the portability of a dockerized LAMP service using a build I found but with fewer steps

After creating an instance of a LAMP service on a Vagrantfile I wanted to see how fast I could deploy then prepare a briefly customized version between ubuntu VMs on Virtual box.  After that I want to roll it out on an AWS deployment.
